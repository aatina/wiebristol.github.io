The children at [Little Stoke Primary School](http://littlestoke.edusite.co.uk/) had told their teachers that they wanted more special assemblies with visitors. The children were well behaved and engaged with my talk; they didn’t even complain when we ran over into break time. Moreover, the teachers were happy to have a female engineer as a role model as this will hopefully challenge stereotypes. It is not exactly news that women are underrepresented in engineering, especially at postgraduate level, and I am a firm believer that if we want to change this, exposure to female role models needs to start as early as possible.

Every question I asked was met with lots of raised hands and inquisitive further questions. As I was talking about telecommunications, they were very excited to talk about their phones and TVs. Visual aids worked very well with lots of pictures and a 1980 Motorola brick phone (kindly borrowed from [Prof. Mark Beach](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering/people/mark-a-beach/index.html)) attracted lots of attention.

Upon arrival the teacher showed me some the schools core values which were displayed around the assembly hall. Things like ‘never give up’, ‘work hard’ etc. This meant that I could incorporate these into what I was saying to highlight the importance of these values in the working world.

Overall, it was a very positive experience. However, there are a few things I would do differently if I could go back. Most importantly, never underestimate the children! Technological advances mean that the school curriculums have changed vastly since I was in school. If I had known that they had already studied coding then I could have tweaked my presentation to provide examples more relevant to their existing knowledge in coding. Luckily this wasn’t too much of a problem as the teacher stepped in at the end and explained the connection between my presentation and their lessons. I would urge anybody doing a similar talk to find out what the school has already taught them. I also wish that I could have stayed a little longer after – I hadn’t realised the assembly was followed by a break time where the children could have asked more questions.

After the talk I received an email from the school saying that “some children remarked that they now want to go to university”. It provides great satisfaction to learn that you have planted these seeds of imagination and I would really recommend the experience to everyone. After all, it only took one morning!
