I'm very excited to announce the launch of this new website! The new website brings, for the first time, an official online presence for Women in Engineering Society and also brings dedicated emails - [role]@wiebristol.co.uk.

You may notice some relatively empty sections of the site at the moment. We've just voted in a new committee and launched the website so while we learn-the-ropes, we'll also be gathering content for the site! **You can contribute** by following the [guide on this page]({% include github_file_url file="_docs/Contributing.md" %}) - you **don't need to know HTML/CSS** to contribute but needless to say, if you want to use HTML/CSS, you can.

The site has been built on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) (with no use of JavaScript making it very responsive). Jekyll uses [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) for content (e.g. [this article]({% include github_file_raw_url file="_posts/2016-04-20-Website-launch.markdown" %})) which makes writing well-formatted content extremely easy! It even supports syntax highlighting for code snippets. Jekyll and [Github]({{ site.github_username | prepend: "https://github.com/" }}) combined make it inexpensive and convenient for us to both manage contributions from our community and generate the blog system in the site. Additionally, it allows us to maintain a consistent theme across the site without limiting what advanced users can contribute.

Please keep checking back (particularly from the start of September) to see our upcoming events, helpful support resources and outreach work! Or you can [sign up to our mailing list]({{ site.mailing_list_signup_url }}) to receive direct updates (and of course, no spam!).
