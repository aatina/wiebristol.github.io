## What is sponsorship used for?

Sponsorship for the society is used to support our key activities: [events]({{ "/events" | prepend: site.base_url }}); [outreach]({{ "/outreach" | prepend: site.base_url }}) and supporting our community.

We've detailed below our three sponsorship packages which cover each our main activity areas. If you have an alternative proposition though we'd love to hear from you! Please contact our president ([Alexis Monks](mailto:president@wiebristol.co.uk)) or our treasurer ([Ed Nutting](mailto:treasurer@wiebristol.co.uk)).
