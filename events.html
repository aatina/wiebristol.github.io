											<td>WiE are getting involved in the Bristol Science Film Festival (BSFF) and we want you to join us! The aim is to submit a '10 minute short film on a science theme that interests you'. If you have something that really interests you or you want to be involved then come along to BTP on Park Street and brainstorm ideas with us. The deadline for submitting a film is February, with filming taking place the first week back after exams. We will be finalising the plan for our storyline before the end of term and letting you know how you can take part in the filming if you're interested. Also if we come up with loads of great ideas maybe we can make more than one film!</td>
