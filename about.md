excerpt: A brief history of the society.

The Women in Engineering society was founded in 2014 by Eve Tymon (pictured far left). The society was formed as a forum for women to network and support one another within the engineering faculty at the University of Bristol.

The next elected president of the society was Holly Baker (pictured one in from the right) Holly wanted to help the society increase it’s visibility in the faculty, mainly through the design of our logo, the creation of t-shirts, banners and posters that were on show around the university.  For the first time ever, we gave talks in first year introductory lectures, which contributed to the success of our welcome meal attracting around forty new female engineers. We grew the mailing list, ran outreach in schools, and held an extremely popular talk on unconscious bias. Internally we have had a very successful year, especially making links within the faculty, Holly helped the Merchant Venturers school with it’s Athena Swan application (an award for equality). In the future, she would love to see the society be able to put on events more regularly and grow our small community into something much greater. Holly 'had an amazing year, learnt a lot about challenging the way you think and was amazingly supported by my committee of passionate, inspiring engineers every step of the way.'

I have been elected as the president for the 2016 - 2017 period, my name is Alexis Monks (pictured far right) and I am so excited about the year to come. I was on the committee last year and we have loads of ideas of how to expand the society further this year. I want to boost membership and visibility throughout the university and increase participation in all events. The most important thing for me is that the women in the faculty feel supported, and I want this society to provide a fun way to do this. I will update this space as to all the successes of the year.
